## Purpose and Importance of the datasets & main questions

According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Originally, the dataset come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. It consists of 401,958 rows and 279 columns. The vast majority of columns are questions asked to respondents about their health status, such as "Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?" or "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life".There are many different factors (questions) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease, so we decided to select the most relevant variables from it and do some cleaning so that it would be usable for machine learning projects. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition. This dataset can be used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, etc.).

## Data Source Introduction & Possible limitations and ethical questions

We found the heart disease from Kaggle. Originally, the dataset comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), edited by KAMIL PYTLAK. Dataset collected by survey, by asking questions about people's health status such as "Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?". Data was collected because heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US, and there are some key factors related to heart disease. So the dataset can be helpful for us to improve personal health and avoid heart disease. There are a total of 18 features and 319796 rows in the dataset; the original dataset from CDC has 401,958 rows and 279 columns.
We think there are some limitations in this dataset. First of all, the dataset seems to only contain surveys from the U.S. but not other countries. Second, there are some columns such as general health, mental health and physical health, are really subjective. Those features do not have a standard and vary people by people. Last but not least, the dataset is being filtered by other people because the original dataset is too messy and contains too much information, so their might other feature that influence the result that we did not know. So those factors can cause some bias.
Also when we work with data, we need to be as objective as possible, and not bring some stereotype and common sense such as drink is bad for the heart because those might be incorrect.

The dataset is in the form of a combination of numerical and categorical, so we need to use different techniques. Also, some classifier machine learning will be helpful to predict the heat disease but we need to find some models from other places. Besides, we need to find some way to convert categories columns such as one-hot encoding (pandas.get_dummies in python). We used scikit-learn in python before but we never use machine learning in R. So we will try to find some way to apply machine learning in R. We will see if itâ€™s possible to apply ML in our project. Ethical questions to be concerned include that it's essential to consider fairness and justice while providing treatment, such as the distribution of health resources, and respect is necessary when patients choose to receive or refuse certain methods of treatments based on their different beliefs.
Because of the limitations in the dataset that only contains people who live in the U.S, we can't make full analysis for the global area. Also because some factors are subjective, the result depends on people's own definition but not the general standard. So the result might not truly represent some factor.
