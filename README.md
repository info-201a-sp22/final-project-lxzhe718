# Introduction

According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Originally, the dataset come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. It consists of 401,958 rows and 279 columns. The vast majority of columns are questions asked to respondents about their health status, such as “Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?” or “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life”.There are many different factors (questions) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease, so we decided to select the most relevant variables from it and do some cleaning so that it would be usable for machine learning projects. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect “patterns” from the data that can predict a patient's condition. This dataset can be used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, etc.).

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
Usually, Smoking increases the formation of plaque in blood vessels. Coronary Heart Disease occurs when arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle are narrowed by plaque or blocked by clots. Chemicals in cigarette smoke cause the blood to thicken and form clots inside veins and arteries. According to the data, the bar chart shows that there are around 12.2% people who were diagnosed with heart disease have smoking habits and only 6.0% for those who does not smoke. Similarly, for people who previously had stokes, they tend to have heart disease much more than those who does not, with the percentage of 36.4% comparing to 7.4 percentage.
Age and gender is also a big category for heart disease. Aging can cause changes in the heart and blood vessels that may increase a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
